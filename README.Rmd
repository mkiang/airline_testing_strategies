## Introduction 

Reproducible code for our paper, [*Routine testing strategies for airline travel during the COVID-19 pandemic: a simulation analysis*](TODO), in which we use microsimulation to estimate the effectiveness of different testing strategies on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a cohort of hypothetical airline travels.

### Abstract
**Background:** Airline travel has been significantly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic due to concern for individual risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and population-level transmission risk from importation. Routine viral testing strategies for COVID-19 may facilitate safe airline travel through reduction of individual and/or population-level risk, although the effectiveness and optimal design of these “test-and-travel” strategies remain unclear. 

**Methods:** We developed a microsimulation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a cohort of airline travelers to evaluate the effectiveness of various testing strategies to reduce individual risk of infection and population-level risk of transmission. We evaluated five testing strategies in asymptomatic passengers: i) anterior nasal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) within 3 days of departure; ii) PCR within 3 days of departure and PCR 5 days after arrival; iii) rapid antigen test on the day of travel (assuming 90% of the sensitivity of PCR during active infection); iv) rapid antigen test on the day of travel and PCR 5 days after arrival; and v) PCR within 3 days of arrival alone. The travel period was defined as three days prior to the day of travel and two weeks following the day of travel, and we assumed passengers followed guidance on mask wearing during this period. The primary study outcome was cumulative number of infectious days in the cohort over the travel period (population-level transmission risk); the secondary outcome was the proportion of infectious persons detected on the day of travel (individual-level risk of infection). Sensitivity analyses were conducted. 

**Findings:** Assuming a community SARS-CoV-2 incidence of 50 daily infections, we estimated that in a cohort of 100,000 airline travelers followed over the travel period, there would be a total of 2,796 (95% UI: 2,031, 4,336) infectious days with 229 (95% UI: 170, 336) actively infectious passengers on the day of travel. The pre-travel PCR test (within 3 days prior to departure) reduced the number of infectious days by 35% (95% UI: 27, 42) and identified 88% (95% UI: 76, 94) of the actively infectious travelers on the day of flight; the addition of PCR 5 days after arrival reduced the number of infectious days by 79% (95% UI: 71, 84). The rapid antigen test on the day of travel reduced the number of infectious days by 32% (95% UI: 25, 39) and identified 87% (95% UI: 81, 92) of the actively infectious travelers; the addition of PCR 5 days after arrival reduced the number of infectious days by 70% (95% UI: 65, 75). The post-travel PCR test alone (within 3 days of landing) reduced the number of infectious days by 42% (95% UI: 31, 51). The ratio of true positives to false positives varied with the incidence of infection. The overall study conclusions were robust in sensitivity analysis. 

**Interpretation:** Routine asymptomatic testing for COVID-19 prior to travel can be an effective strategy to reduce individual risk of COVID-19 infection during travel, although post-travel testing with abbreviated quarantine is likely needed to reduce population-level transmission due to importation of infection when traveling from a high to low incidence setting.

## Structure

This project is structured as follows: 

- `code`: Contains all code used for this project. Designed to be run sequentially. A brief overview of the code files is provided below.
- `data`: Contains all data necessary to reproduce our tables and plots.
- `intermediate_files`: Contains temporary files not necessary to reproduce our tables and plots.
- `output`: Contains numerical representations (in `csv` form) of all figures. 
- `plots`: Contains all figures used the manuscript in `jpg` and `pdf`.
- `rmds`: Contains useful rmarkdown files such as reproducing our tables and providing session information.

Note, we use the `config.yml` file to modify high-level project-wide parameters. All information necessary for full reproducibility, including package version numbers, is available in `./rmds/02_session_info.html`.

### `config.yml`

Simulation parameters such as the length of quarantine, number of burn-in days, number of passengers, proportion of subclinical infections, daily probability of infection, etc. can be changed in the `config.yml` file. In addition, the `config.yml` file lets you specify different sensitivity analysis configurations and allows you to vary one (or more) parameters across the default parameter sweep. See the `config.yml` file for details.

## `./code`

The analytic pipeline in the `./code`/ folder is designed to have each file run sequentially. That is, each file performs a discrete task and some tasks may be dependent on the output of previous tasks. 

- `utils.R`: Contains almost all helper functions and functions necessary to run the simulations or create the plots. Most functions within `utils.R` uses the [`roxygen2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html) documentation template. See this documentation for expected input, output, and notes about each function. 
- `01_create_simulated_populations.R`: Creates and performs the burn-in for all simulated passenger cohorts. In addition, each simulation state is saved with the random seed used to create the simulation as well as the seed necessary to resume the simulation. Each testing scenario calls one of the simulation states created here (using `unpack_simulation_state()`). 
- `02_run_main_simulations.R`: Run all testing scenarios used for the main results. Each simulation result is saved in `./intermediate_files` to be collected later using `04_summarize_infection_quantities.R` and `05_summarize_testing_quantites.R` and then saved in `./data`.
- `03_run_sensitivity_analyses.R`: Run all testing scenarios used for the main results. Each simulation result is saved in `intermediate_files` to be collected later using `04_summarize_infection_quantities.R` and `05_summarize_testing_quantites.R` and then saved in `./data`.
- `04_summarize_infection_quantities.R`: Collects all the files created in `02` and `03` in `./intermediate_files`, processes them, and then saves the result in `./data`. This file saves the time-varying quantities of interest and our primary end points.
- `05_summarize_testing_quantites.R`: Collects all the files created in `02` and `03` in `./intermediate_files`, processes them, and then saves the result in `./data`. This file saves the time-invariant quantities (e.g., testing results). 

Other files can be run in any order after `04` and `05` have successfully run. These files create plots used in the main manuscript or associated appendix. 

### `./code/testing_scenarios`

Testing scenarios are written as functions that take in all necessary parameters and return no output, instead they save their intermediate results in a temporary location. The structure each function is the same:

1. Load a simulated population using `unpack_simulation_state()`
1. Increment pre-flight time steps
1. Increment the day-of-flight time step
1. Increment post-flight time steps
1. Repeat these steps `n_reps` number of times
1. Save all `n_reps` realizations into a temporary file in `./intermediate_files`

The scenarios themselves change in what happens within each stage above. For example, pre-flight testing strategies would occur in Step 2. The day-of-flight risk multiplier only impacts Step 3. Post-flight testing strategies occur in Step 4. See the documentation within each scenario file in `./code/testing_scenarios` for details.
